# A quantum circuit compiler in Rust

## Building the project

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Running the synthesis algorithm

The directory `benchmarks/chem/` contains text files describing set of Pauli operators used in UCCSD Ans√§tze.
The file names are pretty straightforward to parse.

Once the crate is compiled, you can run the synthesizer as follows:

```bash
./target/release/qrust <FILENAME> 
```

By default, the program prints the output circuit. You can simply ask the program for the running time, the CNOT count, and the CNOT depth
by adding the flag `--onlyinfo` (the circuits might be huge).

```bash
./target/release/qrust <FILENAME> --onlyinfo
```

You can switch between the count and depth minimizing algorithms via the `--metric` option:

```bash
./target/release/qrust <FILENAME> --onlyinfo --metric=depth
```

or

```bash
./target/release/qrust <FILENAME> --onlyinfo --metric=count
```
