# Rustiq: A quantum circuit compiler in Rust

## Python library

All the synthesis methods are binded in python and the repo can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install . 
```

You might need to install rust!

## Building the project (Rust)


```bash
cargo build --release
```


## Running the synthesis algorithm

### In python

See the `examples/circuit_synthesis.py` file for an example.

### Using the command line tool

The directory `benchmarks/chem/` contains text files describing set of Pauli operators used in UCCSD Ans√§tze.
The file names are pretty straightforward to parse.

Once the crate is compiled, you can run the synthesizer as follows:

```bash
./target/release/rustiq <FILENAME> 
```

By default, the program prints the output circuit. You can simply ask the program for the running time, the CNOT count, and the CNOT depth
by adding the flag `--onlyinfo` (the circuits might be huge).

```bash
./target/release/rustiq <FILENAME> --onlyinfo
```

You can switch between the count and depth minimizing algorithms via the `--metric` option:

```bash
./target/release/rustiq <FILENAME> --onlyinfo --metric=depth
```

or

```bash
./target/release/rustiq <FILENAME> --onlyinfo --metric=count
```

Finally, you can ask the compiler to preserve the operator ordering (up to allowed commutations) using `--keeporder` flag:

```bash
./target/release/rustiq <FILENAME> --keeporder
```
